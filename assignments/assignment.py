        3. Compute the between-class scatter matrix.
        4. Compute the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues for the scatter matrices.
        5. Sort the eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues and choose k eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues to form a d×k dimensional matrix W.
        6. Use this d×k eigenvector matrix to transform the samples onto the new subspace.

# TODO: Generating adversarial examples for PCA.
# We will generate adversarial examples for PCA. The adversarial examples are generated by creating two well-separated clusters in a 2D space. Then, we will apply PCA to the data and check if the clusters are still well-separated in the transformed space.
# Your task is to generate adversarial examples for PCA, in which
# the clusters are well-separated in the original space, but not in the PCA space. The separabilit of the clusters will be measured by the K-means clustering algorithm in the test script.
#
# Hint:
# - You can place the two clusters wherever you want in a 2D space.
# - For example, you can use `np.random.multivariate_normal` to generate the samples in a cluster. Repeat this process for both clusters and concatenate the samples to create a single dataset.
# - You can set any covariance matrix, mean, and number of samples for the clusters.
